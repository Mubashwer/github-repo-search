# GitHub Browser Plugin Icons

Since we can't generate actual PNG files through this interface, you'll need to create the following icon files:

## Required Icons:
- `public/icons/icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `public/icons/icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels  
- `public/icons/icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `public/icons/icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Design Suggestions:
- Use a combination of GitHub's octocat logo and a search/magnifying glass icon
- Use GitHub's brand colors: #24292e (dark) and #0366d6 (blue)
- Make sure the icons are clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Consider using a simple "GH" text logo with a search icon overlay

You can create these icons using:
- Figma, Sketch, or other design tools
- Online icon generators
- AI image generators with prompts like "GitHub search icon, simple, clean design"

For now, the extension will work without these icons, but Chrome will show default placeholder icons.
